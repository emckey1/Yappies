# bgc-project

A communications app developed as a C# ASP.NET MVC Progressive Web App. This is designed to target the app store on mobile devices. 

Created to allow community workers to create programs that users can authenticate into, allowing parents to see the programs that their children are in, check the calendar, schedules, announcements, events, etc.

Also designed to allow users to recieve and send private messages to their program supervisors, having personal conversations.

Most of the data has been removed due to the Boys & Girls Club of Niagara implementing this app, but enough has been kept to demonstrate my work done.

My work included:
- Controllers
- Views for Activity, Program Details
- Chat implementation
- All Data Models

I recommend using Visual Studio to launch the project, built using ASP.NET CORE 2.1 & the MVC framework.
